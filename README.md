## Create Required Pages

Before using the theme, you need to create the following pages:

```bash
hexo new page publications
hexo new page projects

```yaml

```

Similarly, set the layout for other pages to match their names (e.g., `layout: projects` for projects page, `layout: talks` for talks page, etc.).
